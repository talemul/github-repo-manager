# GitHub Repo Manager

This project provides a Bash script to automate the initialization, local commit, and remote push of multiple GitHub repositories. It also automatically creates GitHub repositories if they don't already exist using the GitHub CLI.

## üîß Features

- Initializes a Git repository in each project folder.
- Commits the code (if not already committed).
- Creates a remote GitHub repository (if missing).
- Pushes the code to the `main` branch.
- Fully automates multi-repo setup for teams and solo devs.

## üß∞ Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
  - Run `gh auth login` once to authenticate with GitHub.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talemul/github-repo-manager.git
   ```

2. Place your Laravel packages or other projects in the same directory.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the script using Git Bash:

```bash
bash init_and_push_all.sh
